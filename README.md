Welcome to my Weather App! This application is designed to provide users with real-time weather information for any city around the world. Whether you're planning a trip, checking the weather in your hometown, or simply curious about the climate in another part of the globe, this app is here to help.

When you enter the name of a city, the app fetches the current weather data from a reliable weather API and presents it in an easy-to-understand format. You'll see the current temperature, which is displayed in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, so you can choose the unit you're most comfortable with. Additionally, the app provides detailed information on the weather conditions, such as whether it's sunny, rainy, snowy, or cloudy.

But that's not all! The app also gives you insights into the humidity levels and wind speed, which are crucial for understanding the overall weather conditions. This can help you decide what to wear, whether to carry an umbrella, or if it's a good day for outdoor activities.

One of the best features of this weather app is its responsive design. It works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring you have access to weather updates no matter where you are.

The Weather App is built using modern web technologies. HTML5 is used for the structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic content and API integration. The result is a sleek, user-friendly interface that makes checking the weather a breeze.

Give it a try and see how easy it is to stay updated on the weather for any city you choose. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome as they help improve the app and enhance the user experience.
